This folder contains...

* 8474 groundnet.xml files (parking locations for 8474 airports)
with AI taxi routes for 1141 airports.
(made with aptdat2sqlite.py && sqlite2xml.py)

* jetways.xml files for 259 airports. Enable AI Jetways if you like to see & use them.
(made with dsf2stg.py )

WARNING:
* use at your own risk!
* make a backup of your existing Airports folder
* this package does not contain ils,twr,threshold files!
* at some airports you will see duplicate jetways: shared objects form the stg file and the AI jetways from this package.
* the jetways will not fit exactly to the buildings
* at some airports you'll see jetways but no buildings because nobody made the terminal buildings yet.
